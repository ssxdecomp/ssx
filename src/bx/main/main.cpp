// Fun trivia: In an interview with Scott Henshaw (lead director for SSX OG), he says:
// <QUOTE>
// Getting there, like spending your entire Christmas break trying to get a CD to simply boot working with Our lead SE Jon Spencer was a challenge.
// We had a hand-soldered PS2 direct from Sony, but no docs were written yet.
// Jon had to guess at using the same boot sequence as a PS1. 
// To debug it we added a screen clear to a different color after each line of code (there was no debugger).
// each time he compiled and built I had to create a bootable disc with the sony PS1 tools (think 1 hr per disk).
// Then try and boot it and figure out which colour we got stuck at.
// Took the two of us 5 days just to get that working.  
// The challenge was fun.
// </QUOTE>
//
// The one paramater passed to this function looks *suspiciously* like 
// a GS BGCOLOR. In other words: This function probably did exactly this.
// It's kind of funny that it was never removed.
